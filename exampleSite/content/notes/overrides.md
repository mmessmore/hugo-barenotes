Locations of files to override for customization.

## Custom CSS

You can use `/static/css/site.css` to add custom CSS to your site.  It is
loaded after all the theme CSS, so you can tweak things without having to
replace the entire style sheet for the site.

## Syntax Highlighting

You can override the syntax highlighting style by adding
`/static/css/syntax.css` generated by chroma with your favorite style.
