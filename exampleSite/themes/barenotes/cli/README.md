# Barenotes CLI

This is a CLI to facilitate using Hugo as a personal notes/TODO system via the
[messynotes hugo theme](../).

This will only work on Unix-like operating systems because I didn't even try to
support Windows pathing and don't have a Windows system to test on.

*If you fall in that use case and want to contribute support, please do*

This was originally a shell script and is matching that functionality as an
MVP, with plans to add more sophisticated options as it evolves.
